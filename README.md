# Turing Machine

## Objective 
To implement a turing machine, a mathematical model of computation that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. 
The program will read the symbol from the tape in the cell currently under the read/write pointer. Then, given the current state of the Turing machine and the value of the symbol read from the tape, write a symbol to the tape in the cell currently under the read/write pointer, change state, and move the read/write pointer to the cell on the left or right of the cell currently under the read/write pointer. The symbol written to the tape, the change of state, and the direction that the read/write pointer is moved is determined by the rule in the action table that corresponds to the current state and the value of the symbol read from the tape.

## Equipment 
Computer running Windows, MacOS or Linux, with an Intel or AMD based processor (x86 or x86-64) with administrator privileges. Linux (g++), Visual Studio, or XCode is recommended.
